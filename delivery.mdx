title: Distribution Operating Principles
---
# Primary Focus

Distribution comes before delivery sophistication. Demand first, optimisation later.

# What Distribution Means

A reliable way for the right people to discover us, understand what we do, and start a conversation.

## Core Rule

One message × one primary channel × consistent execution.

## Canonical Message

We help founder-led businesses reduce operational chaos by designing simple systems that remove manual work and improve decision-making.

## Primary Channel

Direct outreach (email / LinkedIn DM). LinkedIn content supports credibility only.

## Conversion Flow

Conversation ® Discovery ® Paid Pilot.

## Daily Execution Minimum

One focused outreach block per working day. No creativity requirement.

## Weekly KPI

At least two meaningful conversations per week.

## Enforcement Rule

Miss KPI two weeks in a row ® pause everything else and fix distribution.

## Non Negotiables

No message rewrites for 90 days. No extra channels. Boring execution is a feature, not a bug.
